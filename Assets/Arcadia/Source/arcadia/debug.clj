;; Differs from some other implementations in that it:
;; - actually runs repl for off-thread breakpoints on their own threads,
;;   which is important in Unity.
;; - does not expose connection to off-thread breakpoints in a stack-like way:
;;   if at breakpoint A you connect to breakpoint B, then C, then disconnect
;;   from C, you return to A, not B. This prevents accumulating weird
;;   implicit paths, there's no administrative cost to jumping around between
;;   breakpoints.
;; - special breakpoint commands (connect, show available breakpoints, etc)
;;   are all expressed as top-level repl inputs with no evaluation semantics,
;;   such as `:a` and `[:c 0]`. These are only meaningful from within a breakpoint.
;; - supports interrupts for contingency that a breakpoint is hit on the
;;   main repl's eval thread, but not during a main repl eval. Breakpoints
;;   encountered during execution of Unity events are examples of this.

;; Caveats
;; - The main repl thread is currently hard-coded to be Unity's main thread.
;; - Currently no support for multiple repls, attempting to use with multiple
;;   repls could lead to deadlock or other weird behavior.

  "Multithreaded breakpoint macro.

When a `(break)` form is encountered on any thread, that thread's
  execution will 'hang' as if it were running a REPL and awaiting
  further input. To connect to a breakpoint on an off-REPL thread,
  open a breakpoint in the REPL by evaluating a `(break)` form, then
  use the special syntax `[:c <index of breakpoint to connect to>]` at
  the top level of the new REPL context. For example:

```
my.namespace=> (future (let [x (+ 1 2)] (break)))

my.namespace=> (break)

;; print available breakpoints:
debug:6=> :a 
Inx Thread Break-ID
0   30     7

;; connect to the breakpoint at `Inx` 0:
debug:6=> [:c 0]
;; evaluate some code from that context:
debug:7=> x
3

;; quit this breakpoint, popping up to the previous breakpoint level:
debug:7=> :q
debug:8=>

;; pop up to top REPL level:
debug:8=> :q
my.namespace=>
```

For a summary of the in-breakpoint DSL, evaluate `:h` from within a
  breakpoint.

At the moment the `break` macro takes a single keyword-arguments
  option, `:when`. When the breakpoint is encountered, the `:when`
  expression will be evaluated if present. If the result is truthy,
  the breakpoint will be entered as normal, otherwise it will be
  skipped.

```
my.namespace=> (defn some-func [x]
                  (break :when (< x 5))
                  x)
#'arcadia.debug/some-func
my.namespace=> (some-func 7)
7
my.namespace=> (some-func 3)
debug:13=> x
3
```

`break` always returns `nil`.

This macro is intended for use with Arcadia's socket REPL. It may work
  with other REPLs in some circumstances, but probably won't for
  breakpoints triggered by Unity events that run on Unity's main
  thread. In fact, if the REPL is also evaluating on the main thread,
  such a breakpoint will almost certainly crash that REPL (since its
  thread is blocked), and effectively crash Unity itself.
