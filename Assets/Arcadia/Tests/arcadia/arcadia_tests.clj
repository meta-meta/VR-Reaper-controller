  Syntax: (with-temp-objects kv-opts* bindings? body*)

  `kv-opts*` are optional key-value pairs. They can be the following:

  :ms      - evaluated value is milliseconds before objects are retired
  :frames  - evaluated value is player frames before objects are retired
  :eframes - evaluated value is editor frames before objects are retired
  :lit     - value should be a vector of symbols which will be bound to
             new GameObjects (see below)

  `bindings` is an optional vector binding form, and has the same
  syntax as `clojure.core/let`.  Every value bound to a symbol in it
  should be a GameObject instance, since `arcadia.core/retire` will
  get called on all of them.

  If the :lit key is provided, the symbols in its vector value will be
  bound to new GameObject instances named after their corresponding symbol.

  When GameObjects bound in `bindings` or through the `:lit` vector
  get retired depends on the supplied options `:ms`, `:frames`, or `:eframes`. If
  both are provided an error is thrown. If neither is provided the
  GameObjects are retired as soon as `body` is evaluated."
